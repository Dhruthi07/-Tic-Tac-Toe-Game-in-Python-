# -Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-in-Python-
This Tic Tac Toe project in Python is a beginner-friendly implementation of the classic game, focusing on procedural programming. It includes three modes: Player vs. Player, Player vs. Computer, and Computer vs. Computer. Players or the AI take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, and the winner is determined by matching rows, columns, or diagonals.

Key highlights:

1.Game Logic: The program uses logical conditions to determine valid moves, check for a winner, or declare a draw.
2.AI Integration: The AI uses a simple heuristic approach to either win or block the opponent strategically.
3.No OOP: This project showcases procedural programming with functions for modularity and clarity.
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals, practice clean code design, and implement real-world logic in a fun way. Itâ€™s a great starting point for anyone looking to explore game development in Python!
